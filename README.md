# chirpstack-decoders
Slightly modified decoders for Chirpstack V4.

**ATTENTION:** These can be modified decoders in the sense that they output different variable names than the original decoders!
As an example: Digital Matter devices normally store their lat and lng in "latitudeDeg" and "longitudeDeg". I've changed this to simply "latitude" and "longitude".
