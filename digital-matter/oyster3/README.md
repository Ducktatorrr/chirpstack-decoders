# Digital Matter Oyster3

Digital Matter says: _Next-generation of our best-selling Oyster series â€“ Ultra-rugged battery-powered GPS asset tracking device for LoRaWAN networks featuring 10 years battery life (4x battery life of Oyster LoRaWAN V1)_

## Modifications made

- "latitudeDeg" and "longitudeDeg" are now "latitude" and "longitude"
- only the essential ports available. Who uses the oyster3 in detailed33 mode anyways

## Note:

I currently use the v2 decoder
