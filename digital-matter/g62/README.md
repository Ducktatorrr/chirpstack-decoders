# Digital Matter G62

Digital Matter says: *Robust and ultra-rugged vehicle and heavy equipment tracking device with inputs/outputs for fleet management, equipment monitoring on LoRaWANÂ® networks*

## Modifications made

- "latitudeDeg" and "longitudeDeg" are now "latitude" and "longitude"
- "runtime" now simply outputs the runtime in seconds and no longer a clumsy string in format "0d00h00m00s" for more flexibility
